Super-resolution refers to the task of increasing the dimensions of an image from a Low resolution image to a High resolution image. This problem has been an active research problem for the past couple of decades. Earlier techniques used interpolation in the form of bicubic interpolation, bi-linear interpolation etc. Recently people have used CNNs, GANs and Autoencoders to do image super-resolution with convincing results. More recently researchers used randomly-initialized deep neural nets as priors to achieve promising results. In this project, we compare two modern revolutionary techniques used for Superresolution: LapSRN and Deep Image Prior. Furthermore, we experiment Charbonnier Loss with Deep Image Prior. We also experiment with weighted intermediate losses in LapSRN instead of an unweighted loss.
